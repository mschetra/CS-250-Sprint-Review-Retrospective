# CS-250 Sprint Review & Retrospective

## 📄 Description
This Sprint Review and Retrospective demonstrates how I applied Agile and Scrum practices to interpret user needs, manage tasks, and reflect on team performance. Including it in my portfolio highlights growth in collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement.

## Essential Questions

**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
User stories help me understand requirements from the user’s perspective, guiding development toward meaningful solutions. They break down complex goals into manageable tasks and keep the focus on customer value.

**2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I approach development iteratively, using sprints to deliver working features and gather feedback. I plan to incorporate sprint planning, retrospectives, backlog refinement, and continuous testing to stay flexible and user-focused.

**3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
It means communicating clearly, collaborating effectively, and being accountable. A good team member supports others, contributes ideas, adapts to change, and helps the team achieve shared goals.
